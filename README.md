**Engge Framework** is a C++ framework based on SDL.

## Why
I need a basic 2D framework for **engge** which needs to be:
- cross platform
- easy to use
- easy to understand (my code, my mistake)
- with only the piece of code I need for **engge**

## Dependencies
I try not have too much dependencies, but also it's not necessary to code something already nice-done.
